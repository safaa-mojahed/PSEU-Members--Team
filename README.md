# PSEU-Members--Team
This project is a simple directory for PSEU Team Members. The user can add, delete or update any member.
When the user are going to add new member, he need to enter the name, email, major, role, and biography of the member, all 
this fields are required, and the email address must be unique, if the user want to add the new member at the bottom or at a 
specific index, he can do this. When the user click on save the new member will be added and appear in the page. Also we have
filter, so the user can sort the displayed elements, and filter them based on their role, and their major, and he can use the 
search bar.
